# NBA Draft Analysis - Enjoy Basketball Pitch

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of data visualisation and analytics capabilities for the **Enjoy Basketball** brand. 

**Live Demo:** [Insert your Streamlit link here]

## What This Shows

This interactive tool analyses the relationship between NBA draft position and current season performance, answering questions like:
- How predictive is draft position for NBA success?
- Which late-round picks are outperforming expectations?
- Are there any early lottery picks struggling to meet expectations?

The visualisation allows users to:
- Toggle between different performance metrics (PPG, FG%, 3P%, rebounds, assists)
- Filter by minimum minutes played to focus on rotation players
- Identify correlation strength between draft position and performance
- Discover hidden gems and potential busts in the 2024 draft class

## Potential Use Cases for Enjoy Shows

This type of analysis could support:

- **Newsletter deep dives** - Embed interactive charts directly in Beehiiv posts
- **Podcast talking points** - Data-driven discussion topics for episodes
- **Social media content** - Visualisations for Twitter/Instagram
- **Season previews/reviews** - Performance tracking throughout the year
- **Trade deadline analysis** - Which young players are exceeding value?

## Technical Stack

- **Python** for data processing libraries
- **Streamlit** to create interactive web app
- **Plotly** to design visualisations
- **Basketball Reference** for NBA data

## Future Expansion Ideas

Quick projects that could follow this model:
- Trade impact analysis (before/after team performance)
- Shooting efficiency heat maps by player or team
- Playoff prediction models based on regular season trends
- Era comparisons
- Player development tracking

## My Pitch

I built this as a 1-2 hour demonstration project to show how I could contribute data visualisation and analytics to Enjoy Basketball's content. The goal is to help the brand maintain its reputation for smart, substantive basketball coverage that stands out in a crowded media landscape.

<sub>A huge thanks to Kenny, Pierre, Mike and Darrick for being an entertaining and informative channel for basketball content, and to Christian and Austin for making sure the shows happen. I am a massive fan of NOTB and have been around since the TTW days. I am grateful for the time you've taken to read this, much love and support.</sub>
